## Project Idea Proposal

### Overview:
Food waste is a significant issue that not only harms the environment but also impacts the financial well-being of students. Many students struggle with food insecurity, and reducing food waste can help alleviate this problem while also promoting sustainable practices. The proposed "Food Save" Android app aims to address this challenge and support student well-being.

### Aim:
The primary aim of the Food Save app is to empower students to reduce food waste, save money, and contribute to a more sustainable campus environment. By providing tools and resources to manage food resources effectively, the app will help students improve their financial stability, reduce stress, and promote overall well-being.

### Key Functionality:

1. **Food Inventory Management**: The app will allow users to track the food items they have at home, set expiration reminders, and receive personalized recommendations to use up perishable items before they spoil.

2. **Food Donation and Sharing**: The app will connect students with local food banks, shelters, or campus organizations that accept food donations. Users can also share surplus food with their peers through a built-in food-sharing platform.

3. **Educational Resources**: The app will offer educational content and tips on sustainable food practices, food storage, and waste reduction. This will help students develop better habits and raise awareness about the importance of reducing food waste.

4. **Rewards**: The app will incorporate elements, such as points, and badges, to encourage students to engage with the app and track their progress in reducing food waste.
