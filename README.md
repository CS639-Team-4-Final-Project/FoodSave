## Project Idea Proposal

### Overview:
Food waste is a significant issue that not only harms the environment but also impacts the financial well-being of students. Many students struggle with food insecurity, and reducing food waste can help alleviate this problem while also promoting sustainable practices. The proposed "Food Save" Android app aims to address this challenge and support student well-being.

### Aim:
The primary aim of the Food Save app is to empower students to reduce food waste, save money, and contribute to a more sustainable campus environment. By providing tools and resources to manage food resources effectively, the app will help students improve their financial stability, reduce stress, and promote overall well-being.
