## Project Idea Proposal

### Overview:
Food waste is a significant issue that not only harms the environment but also impacts the financial well-being of students. Many students struggle with food insecurity, and reducing food waste can help alleviate this problem while also promoting sustainable practices. The proposed "Food Save" Android app aims to address this challenge and support student well-being.

### Aim:
The primary aim of the Food Save app is to empower students to reduce food waste, save money, and contribute to a more sustainable campus environment. By providing tools and resources to manage food resources effectively, the app will help students improve their financial stability, reduce stress, and promote overall well-being.

### Key Functionality:

1. **Food Inventory Management**: The app will allow users to track the food items they have at home, set expiration reminders, and receive personalized recommendations to use up perishable items before they spoil.

2. **Food Donation and Sharing**: The app will connect students with local food banks, shelters, or campus organizations that accept food donations. Users can also share surplus food with their peers through a built-in food-sharing platform.

3. **Educational Resources**: The app will offer educational content and tips on sustainable food practices, food storage, and waste reduction. This will help students develop better habits and raise awareness about the importance of reducing food waste.

4. **Rewards**: The app will incorporate elements, such as points, and badges, to encourage students to engage with the app and track their progress in reducing food waste.

### Relevance to Student Well-Being and Welfare:
The Food Save app directly addresses student well-being and welfare in the following ways:

1. **⁠Financial Stability**: By helping students reduce food waste and save money, the app can contribute to their financial well-being and alleviate the stress associated with food insecurity.

2. **⁠Sustainability and Environmental Impact**: The app's focus on reducing food waste promotes sustainable practices and environmental stewardship, which can positively impact student mental health and overall well-being.

3. **⁠Community Engagement**: The food donation and sharing features of the app encourage students to engage with their local community, fostering a sense of social responsibility and connection.

4. **⁠Healthy Habits**: The meal planning and recipe suggestions within the app can help students develop healthier eating habits, which are essential for their physical and mental well-being.


In conclusion, the proposed Food Save app aligns with the topic of student well-being and welfare by addressing the financial, environmental, and social aspects of food waste. By empowering students to reduce food waste, the app can positively impact their overall well-being and contribute to a more sustainable campus community.

### Importance of the App:

1. **Environmental Impact:**
   - Food waste accounts for about 1.3 billion tons per year globally, which is roughly one-third of all food produced.[1]
   - The production of wasted food generates greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 36.2 million cars in the US alone.[1]
   - If everyone could master food waste management, it would help eliminate 8% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.[1]

2. **Financial Savings:**
   - Food prices increased by 9.9% in 2022, making food waste management apps a real economical solution.[1]
   - The average restaurant throws away 4-10% of the food they purchase, which translates to thousands of dollars per year.[2]
   - By reducing food waste, restaurants can lower their food costs, increase profit margins, and save on other resources like labor, energy, and waste disposal fees.[2]

3. **Social Impact:**
   - Food waste management apps allow users to share surplus food with their neighbors or donate it to those in need, building social connections.[1]
   - Some apps, like Olio, are nonprofit organizations with a mission to reduce food waste and address food insecurity.[3]

4. **Behavioral Change:**
   - Food waste management apps can change the culture of planning, consuming, and disposing of food, encouraging users to be more thoughtful about their purchases and spending.[1]
   - By sharing their experience with friends and on social networks, users can provoke changes in their community's attitudes towards food waste.[1]

In summary, the food waste management app is crucial for addressing the significant environmental, financial, and social impacts of food waste, while also promoting behavioral change and improving the user experience.

### Comparison to Similar Solutions

Here are three similar food waste management apps available on the Google Play Store, along with a brief description and how they compare to the proposed solution:

1. *Olio*
   - Description: Olio is a food-sharing app that connects neighbors to share surplus food and other items for free.
   - Comparison: While Olio focuses on food sharing and donation, the proposed app has a broader scope, including features for inventory management, meal planning, and campus-specific integration to address student well-being.

2. *Too Good To Go*
   - Description: Too Good To Go is an app that allows users to purchase discounted "magic bags" of unsold food from restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores.
   - Comparison: The proposed app includes the discounted food purchase feature, but also incorporates additional functionalities like recipe suggestions, expiration alerts, and gamification to promote sustainable food practices among students.

3. *Karma*
   - Description: Karma is an app that connects users to restaurants, bakeries, and cafes to purchase discounted surplus food.
   - Comparison: Similar to Too Good To Go, Karma focuses on discounted food purchases, while the proposed app has a more comprehensive approach, including features to address the financial, social, and environmental aspects of food waste in the context of student well-being.

### Technologies and APIs

To develop the proposed food waste management app, the following technologies and APIs may be utilized:

1. *Mobile App Development Frameworks*: 
   - Android: Android Studio, Kotlin

2. *Third-Party APIs and Services*:
   - Google Maps API for location-based features.
   - Firebase for data storage.
   - Integration with university dining services and food donation organizations

By leveraging these technologies and APIs, the proposed food waste management app can provide a comprehensive and innovative solution to address the issue of food waste while promoting student well-being and welfare.
